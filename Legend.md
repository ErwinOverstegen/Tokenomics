# **Definitions**

## **Tokenomics**
Tokenomics is the study of how cryptocurrencies work within the broader ecosystem. This includes such things like token distribution as well as how they can be used to incentivize positive behaviour in the network.

## **Taxonomy**
Along with creating a taxonomy to describe what a token is in detail, the initiative will develop a method for attaching meta-data – transactional descriptive information – to a specific token using the token taxonomy framework's syntax and grammar.

## **Quant Fund**
A quant fund is an investment fund that selects securities by utilizing the capabilities of advanced quantitative analysis. In quant funds, managers build customized models using software programs to determine investments for the fund. 
A quant fund makes investment decisions based on the use of advanced quantitative analysis.
A quantitative fund relies on algorithmic or systematically programmed investment strategies. Quantitative funds can be one of many investment offerings supported by a large asset manager. However, it can also be the central management focus of a specialized investment manager. 

## **Crypto Asset Derivatives**
What Type of Security Token Derivates are we Likely to See?
As the security tokens market evolves, there are several derivative products that are likely to surface in the short term. Interestingly enough, I believe we are going to see both a generation of derivative models that represent security tokens as well as the first group of tokenized market derivatives.
* **Derivatives that Represent Security Tokens:**  
These are mathematical models that speculate on the price of underlying security tokens that can represent alternative assets such as real estate, art, private shares, diamonds or many others.  
* **Security Tokens that Represent Market Derivatives:**  
We can tokenize everything so there is case to made for tokens that represent market derivatives such as options or futures.  
* **Forward-Futures Model**  
Following the model of forward or futures derivatives in financial markets, smart contracts could specify the criteria to buy or sell a security token at a specified future time and at a previously agreed price. These security token derivatives can follow the futures model if traded in centralized exchanges or the forward model if traded in decentralized exchanges.  
* **Options Model**  
The owner of the security token option will have the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying security token at a specified price on a specified date.  
* **ETF Model**  
Exchange-traded-funds are viable for security tokens. ETF-like security tokens could represent the value of an underlying group of assets. Examples are real estate leases, loans or private shares of different companies.  
* **Swap Model**  
Like swap models in financial markets, security token derivatives that exchange the dividends or cash flow produced by two different security tokens in order to serve as a hedge or insurance against future market conditions.  
* **Mutual-Fund Model**  
These are better suited for enterprises such as financial institutions that are looking to issue their own security tokens. Just like ETFs, Mutual-Fund tokens will aggregate a pool of security tokens but, unlike ETFs, they won’t be actively traded and only priced on regular intervals. 
* **Leveraged tokens**  
A leveraged token is a financial derivative that enables you to gain exposure to a leveraged trading position in a digital asset without the complex aspects of managing a margin trade. Leverage tokens are ERC20 tokens that represent a leverage long or short position in a cryptoasset. The main selling point of these new crypto derivative tokens is that they enable you to take leveraged positions without having to deal with collateral, funding rates, margin management, and liquidation.
To make leveraged tokens possible, an exchange issues (and redeems) these tokens in the form of ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. Additionally, the exchange rebalances the tokens on a daily basis. This enables the value of the token to be in line with the value of the underlying digital asset. Theoretically ERC20 is not mandatory, other blockchain could be used as well.

## **Token Classification Table**  
1. **Mode of Payment/Currency**  
The original purpose of cryptocurrencies, more specifically Bitcoin (BTC), was to come up with a universal currency that was not controlled by any institution (decentralised from government, banks, companies etc). In its current state of development, it is not functioning better as a day-to-day currency due to technical limitations in transaction speeds and volume.  
2. **Store of Value**  
While the limitations of blockchain are still being resolved, one irrefutable value of Bitcoin is that it is a reliable store of value. Even with the expensive fees and slow transfer speeds, BTC is widely accepted and recognised to have some value (however volatile it may be), much like an asset.  
3. **Protocol Improvement**  
There are some tokens that do not aim to be a currency, but rather their focus is to solve the problems that underlie blockchain technology so that the technology can advance for even more uses. These tokens usually try to resolve a particular limitation, like making it scalable so as to cope with the increased demand and usage of blockchain, or making it extra anonymous and secure for transacting sensitive money and information. Ark (ARK), for example, seeks to build an inter-blockchain system so that different tokens can communicate with one another. Sharder (SS), on another hand, creates a blockchain storage system that different projects can use an authenticator and secure storage facility.  
4. **Coin-as-a-Service (CAAS)**
Developers play an integral role to maintaining and improving the blockchain, and developing cryptocurrencies generally require a high level of programming expertise and experience. Hence, some cryptocurrencies aim to simplify the programming so that more people can develop their own tokens.
CAAS refers to cryptocurrencies that allow more people to create their own tokens. For example, Ethereum is coded on Solidity language, which has a simpler syntax than Bitcoin, making it easier for programmers to master and write smart contracts with it. With that, a lot of developers have since created their own developer applications (dApps) that uses the Ethereum system. Lisk (LSK) is a CAAS that employs Javascript, so they hope that even more people can create their own coins and tokens since Javascript is already a popular programming language. On the other hand, Simple Token (OST) created an interface that allows mobile application owners to develop their own blockchain tokens to be used in their apps.  
5. **Utility Token**  
Utility tokens are tokens that users will consume in exchange for a service. Each service provider runs his own tokenised system, where users will purchase the credits and use it in exchange for his services. This is similar to how you would purchase tokens to play (service) in an arcade (service provider).
For example, you can buy the tokens of a coin exchange to pay for your transaction fees for trading services on the exchange e.g. Binance Coin (BNB). You can also buy the credits of a marketplace in order to use its services e.g. Dentacoin (DCN), LockChain (LOC), SpankChain (SPANK).
