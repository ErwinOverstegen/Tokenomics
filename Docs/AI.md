# Aritifical Intelligence (AI)

AI has to be discussed in the context of token systems. There are two distictive reasons for that. <br/>
One reason is that *smart contracts* in crypto currencies aren't smart at all. So we need to let the air out of 'smart contracting', 
before people might expect too much from it.<br/>
The second reason is that we very much need AI to re-package tokens into consolidated way or gathered and kept in one or more *funds*
