## Why is assetbacking important
Assetbacking is a key activity and recurring verification to take place. If you can't *identify* all digitally represented objects, it makes no sense to use a token to represent them, nor to value them, nor to exchange them.
The whole operation, in fact the whole token ecosystem falters over a broken assetbacking.
