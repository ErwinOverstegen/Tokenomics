## Why
Tokenization is hot. Steaming hot, and able to create rampant metastases. We need to cool the topic with transparency, protection, and realism. Why? Because people and organizations can burn their fingers when they touch tokens.

Our vision stems for open public cryptocurrencies and the ecosystems behind them. Not your keys not your coins, don't trust verify. The drive in our group to shine a light on the most important issues around Tokenomics stems from experience in business and finance.

## For who
Anyone getting involved with tokens, either as a creator, seller, buyer, facilitator, or regulator needs a standard and a benchmark to able to refer to as soon as interrelated features of tokens in a certain practical context are discussed. These are the benefits of getting our group involved:
1. Classification method comparisson
2. Deterministic token classification
3. Validation 
4. [Reality check](./Realitycheck.md) of the parameters
5. [Assetbacking](./Assetbacking.md)
6. Future role of [Artifical Intelligence](./AI.md)
7. [Legal Embedding](./Legal.md), however reduced and focussed on taxation and legal tender issues

## A token is a moving target

The appearance or the analysis of any token changes along at least three axes
1. the individual perspective of the observer ([roles](./Role based perception of tokens))
2. The lifecycle of a token
3. Maturity of classification methods (see also [Comparison of methods](./ComparisonTC) )

#### What do we keep constant?
 - **The ecosystem**. However, an supporting ecosystem bheind a token will be slowly evolving, but constant enough for token classification and analysis
 - **Jurisdictions** will stay more or less the same after a token ecosystem has chosen where the token operates. In the [legal embedding](./Legal.md) we'll assess the changes in laws and regulations in the chosen jurisdictions and the impact on the token classification.
 - **Asset identification**, when done right will prevail through a product's lifecycle. The valuation is another topic that will be addressed in financial assessment as a part of the [Reality check](./Realitycheck.md)
