In the [Readme](../README.md#A-token-is-a-moving-target) we've stressed how **loose, temporary and multi-interpretable the classification of a token can be**. <br/>
So what can we do to get hold of the topic? We need handles. Firstly we start with the more or less [constant parameters](#What-we-perceive-as-a-constant-factor) that we take as a starting point. Next we describe [what we can benchmark](#Benchmarking) as far as tokens are concerned. Lastly we list the [services](#Services needed) serviceproviders should be able to deliver.

#### What we perceive as a constant factor
 - **The ecosystem**. However, an supporting ecosystem bheind a token will be slowly evolving, but constant enough for token classification and analysis
 - **Jurisdictions** will stay more or less the same after a token ecosystem has chosen where the token operates. In the [legal embedding](./Legal.md) we'll assess the changes in laws and regulations in the chosen jurisdictions and the impact on the token classification.
 - **Asset identification**, when done right will prevail through a product's lifecycle. The valuation is another topic that will be addressed in financial assessment as a part of the [Reality check](./Realitycheck.md)
