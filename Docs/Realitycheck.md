# Realitycheck

## Background

Tokens designed for purpose can have flaws in it, might not pass legal tests, might have no economic relevance, 
and might not be able to be backed by identifiable asset in the first place.<br/>
Repackaging of tokens might lead to a put of a *house of cards*: no real value proposition, obscure, complex and not resiliant. <br/>
Financial construction on top of legal tokens might become illegal, decentralised tokens repackaged could easily become totally 
centralized and under control of crooks (by design) or adversaries (in the operational phase).<br/>

## What needs to be done?
