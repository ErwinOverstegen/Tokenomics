# **Definitions**

## **Tokenomics**
Tokenomics is the study of how cryptocurrencies work within the broader ecosystem. This includes such things like token distribution as well as how they can be used to incentivize positive behaviour in the network.

## **Taxonomy**
Along with creating a taxonomy to describe what a token is in detail, the initiative will develop a method for attaching meta-data – transactional descriptive information – to a specific token using the token taxonomy framework's syntax and grammar.

## **Quant Fund**
A quant fund is an investment fund that selects securities by utilizing the capabilities of advanced quantitative analysis. In quant funds, managers build customized models using software programs to determine investments for the fund. 
A quant fund makes investment decisions based on the use of advanced quantitative analysis.
A quantitative fund relies on algorithmic or systematically programmed investment strategies. Quantitative funds can be one of many investment offerings supported by a large asset manager. However, it can also be the central management focus of a specialized investment manager. 

## **Crypto Asset Derivatives**
What Type of Security Token Derivates are we Likely to See?
As the security tokens market evolves, there are several derivative products that are likely to surface in the short term. Interestingly enough, I believe we are going to see both a generation of derivative models that represent security tokens as well as the first group of tokenized market derivatives.
* **Derivatives that Represent Security Tokens:**  
These are mathematical models that speculate on the price of underlying security tokens that can represent alternative assets such as real estate, art, private shares, diamonds or many others.  
* **Security Tokens that Represent Market Derivatives:**  
We can tokenize everything so there is case to made for tokens that represent market derivatives such as options or futures.
