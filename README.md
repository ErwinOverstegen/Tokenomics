# **Definitions**

## **Tokenomics**
Tokenomics is the study of how cryptocurrencies work within the broader ecosystem. This includes such things like token distribution as well as how they can be used to incentivize positive behaviour in the network.

## **Taxonomy**
Along with creating a taxonomy to describe what a token is in detail, the initiative will develop a method for attaching meta-data – transactional descriptive information – to a specific token using the token taxonomy framework's syntax and grammar.

## **Quant Fund**
A quant fund is an investment fund that selects securities by utilizing the capabilities of advanced quantitative analysis. In quant funds, managers build customized models using software programs to determine investments for the fund. 
A quant fund makes investment decisions based on the use of advanced quantitative analysis.
A quantitative fund relies on algorithmic or systematically programmed investment strategies. Quantitative funds can be one of many investment offerings supported by a large asset manager. However, it can also be the central management focus of a specialized investment manager. 

## **Crypto Asset Derivatives**
What Type of Security Token Derivates are we Likely to See?
As the security tokens market evolves, there are several derivative products that are likely to surface in the short term. Interestingly enough, I believe we are going to see both a generation of derivative models that represent security tokens as well as the first group of tokenized market derivatives.
* **Derivatives that Represent Security Tokens:**  
These are mathematical models that speculate on the price of underlying security tokens that can represent alternative assets such as real estate, art, private shares, diamonds or many others.  
* **Security Tokens that Represent Market Derivatives:**  
We can tokenize everything so there is case to made for tokens that represent market derivatives such as options or futures.  
* **Forward-Futures Model**  
Following the model of forward or futures derivatives in financial markets, smart contracts could specify the criteria to buy or sell a security token at a specified future time and at a previously agreed price. These security token derivatives can follow the futures model if traded in centralized exchanges or the forward model if traded in decentralized exchanges.  
* **Options Model**  
The owner of the security token option will have the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying security token at a specified price on a specified date.  
* **ETF Model**  
Exchange-traded-funds are viable for security tokens. ETF-like security tokens could represent the value of an underlying group of assets. Examples are real estate leases, loans or private shares of different companies.  
* **Swap Model**  
Like swap models in financial markets, security token derivatives that exchange the dividends or cash flow produced by two different security tokens in order to serve as a hedge or insurance against future market conditions.  
* **Mutual-Fund Model**  
These are better suited for enterprises such as financial institutions that are looking to issue their own security tokens. Just like ETFs, Mutual-Fund tokens will aggregate a pool of security tokens but, unlike ETFs, they won’t be actively traded and only priced on regular intervals.
